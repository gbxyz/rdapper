# DESCRIPTION

`rdapper` is a simple RDAP client. It uses [Net::RDAP](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3ARDAP) to retrieve data about
internet resources (domain names, IP addresses, and autonymous systems) and
outputs the information in a human-readable format. If you want to consume this
data in your own program you should use [Net::RDAP](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3ARDAP) directly.

# OPTIONS

You can pass any internet resource as an argument; this may be:

- a "forward" domain name such as `example.com`;
- a top-level domain such as `com`;
- a IPv4 or IPv6 address or CIDR prefix, such as `192.168.0.1` or
`2001:DB8::/32`;
- an Autonymous System Number such as `AS65536`.
- a "reverse" domain name such as `168.192.in-addr.arpa`;
- the URL of an RDAP resource such as
`https://example.com/rdap/domain/example.com`.
- the "tagged" handle of an entity, such as an LIR, registrar, or domain
admin/tech contact. Because these handles are difficult to distinguish from
domain names, you must use the `--type` argument to explicitly tell `rdapper`
that you want to perform an entity query, .e.g `rdapper --type=entity
ABC123-EXAMPLE`.

`rdapper` also implements limited support for in-bailiwick nameservers, but you
must use the `--nameserver` argument to disambiguate from domain names. The
RDAP server of the parent domain's registry will be queried.

## ARGUMENTS

- `--registrar` - follow referral to the registrar's RDAP record (if any)
which will be displayed instead of the registry record.
- `--both` - display both the registry and (if any) registrar RDAP
records (implies `--registrar`).
- `--reverse` - if you provide an IP address or CIDR prefix, then this
option causes `rdapper` to display the record of the corresponding
`in-addr.arpa` or `ip6.arpa` domain.
- `--type=TYPE` - explicitly set the object type. `rdapper` will guess
the type by pattern matching the value of `OBJECT` but you can override this by
explicitly setting the `--type` argument to one of : `ip`, `autnum`,
`domain`, `nameserver`, `entity` or `url`.
    - If `--type=url` is used, `rdapper` will directly fetch the specified
    URL and attempt to process it as an RDAP response. If the URL path ends with
    `/help` then the response will be treated as a "help" query response (if you
    want to see the record for the .help TLD, use `--type=tld help`).
    - If `--type=entity` is used, `OBJECT` must be a a string containing a
    "tagged" handle, such as `ABC123-EXAMPLE`, as per [RFC
    8521](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8521).
- `--$TYPE` - alias for `--type=$TYPE`. eg `--domain`, `--autnum`, etc.
- `--help` - display help message.
- `--version` - display package and version.
- `--raw` - print the raw JSON rather than parsing it.
- `--short` - omit remarks, notices, links and redactions.
- `--bypass-cache` - disable local cache of RDAP objects.
- `--auth=USER:PASS` - HTTP Basic Authentication credentials to be used
when accessing the specified resource. This option **SHOULD NOT** be used unless
you explicitly specify a URL, otherwise your credentials may be sent to servers
you aren't expecting them to.
- `--nocolor` - disable ANSI colors in the formatted output.
- `--search` - perform a search.

# RDAP Search

Some RDAP servers support the ability to perform simple substring searches.
You can use the `--search` option to enable this functionality.

When the `--search` option is used, `OBJECT` will be used as a search term. If
it contains no dots (e.g. `exampl*`), then `rdapper` will send a search query
for `exampl*` to _all_ known RDAP servers. If it contains one or more dots
(e.g. `exampl*.com`), it will send the search query to the RDAP server for the
specified TLD (if any).

Any errors observed will be printed to `STDERR`; any search results will be
printed to `STDOUT`.

As of writing, search is only available for domain names.
